## What you need:

- Junky computer that can boot from a USB Key
- An 8 Gig (or larger) USB key 
- An internet connection to download the image file, the home folder file, as well as Rufus. (We'll get to that below)
- A Watchtower Library CD or installation files

## A few points about what you need...

Firstly you might want to check if the old beast can boot from USB. Actually most computers with USB ports can, but sometimes the feature has to be enabled in the BIOS. You can enable this when you turn on your computer and its just starting up. At the initial black screen when you see the logo of the company that made the PC or laptop, you will have to press a special key to get into the BIOS. Often this is indicated at the bottom of the screen. It might be the DEL key. It could be F2, F10, or F12. If one of those doesn't work, you may have to search on the internet for your model of PC and "BIOS" to find out how to get there. Once in the BIOS screen you should look for "Boot" or "Startup" options. I can't go into all the details here as there are a ton of BIOSes, but it shouldn't be hard to find. You may have to set the order of Boot devices. Try putting the USB first, and the hard drive second. In that way if the USB key is inserted it will boot from the key; If its' not, then the PC will boot from the hard drive.

If your computer doesn't have a CD drive, you will need to copy the Watchtower Library installation files to a second USB key. In many cases if you put the files on the hard drive of your computer, the WTL USB key will be able to find them there.

I have stated an 8 Gig key. Remember the Watchtower Library now takes up about 2 Gig of space. You will need a couple of Gig for the Linux OS, as well as some space to breath. In addition, the Watchtower Library will now want to download Movies etc, and that will start to really take up space.

### OK here we go... Download the 3 files below.

Then go have a coffee or come back tomorrow if you have a slow connection. Once the files are downloaded, continue with
