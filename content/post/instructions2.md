## Now for the fun part !

+ Make sure you have the Watchtower installation files available on CD, a second USB key or your hard drive.
+ Shut down your computer
+ Insert the USB Key you made and restart. You will now have to use the key you found earlier to make your PC or laptop boot from the USB key. Press this several times when you are prompted to or when you see the company logo who made your PC appear on the screen. 
* Once the desktop appears, Click on the Files icon in the dock at the bottom to start the file manager. Navigate to your Watchtower Library install files and double click on WTLSetup.exe. You can also find this easily using the 'Places' menu at the top left. If your installation files are on your hard drive, you may have to look for 'Other places' at the lower left of the File Manager. Once you click on that, you should see your hard drive. Double click on the hard drive and navigate to the spot you left the install files.
* After double clicking on WTLSetup.exe, install Watchtower Library as usual. That's it! Now you can boot with your USB Key and use the Watchtower Library anytime anywhere on any pc! (well almost...)
* Please [let me know](/page/contact/) if there is anything important I missed or if you have any comments or suggestions. Thank you!
