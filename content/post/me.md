I am a volunteer in West Africa. I have spent many enjoyable years both in the field, Bethel, and working with technology. I made this USB Key to help out some brothers and I am providing it here for download free of charge. I'm not requesting any donation... But if you have any part time work that I can do remotely especially technology related I would be ready to help out. 

In short, I have worked in Bethel computer dept, managed the help desk for the Canadian Passport Office. hosted websites, managed email dns servers, and taught a MS Exchange course at the University of British Columbia. I have a lot of experience in virtual technologies on Linux, Amazon and GCE. I can work remotely with full confidence.

This static website is hosted on Google Cloud Platform, and created by me with Hugo static website generator, served by nginx on CentOS. The DNS is hosted on Amazon Route 53.
